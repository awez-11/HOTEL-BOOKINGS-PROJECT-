# HOTEL-BOOKINGS-PROJECT

# 🏨 Hotel Bookings Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a hotel booking dataset to understand customer behavior, booking patterns, and key factors affecting cancellations.  
The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help improve hotel management and marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore and clean the dataset.  
- Identify booking trends across hotel types, months, and customer groups.  
- Analyze factors leading to higher cancellation rates.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed missing and duplicate values.  
- Converted columns to correct data types.  
- Handled inconsistent entries (e.g., country codes, date formats).

## 📊 EDA Steps
1. **Data Overview:** Checked structure, columns, and unique values.  
2. **Univariate Analysis:** Explored each variable (hotel type, country, customer type).  
3. **Bivariate Analysis:** Studied relationships between key features (e.g., lead time vs cancellations).  
4. **Visualization:** Used `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for charts and plots.
